NAME
    Debian::Copyright - manage Debian copyright files

VERSION
    This document describes Debian::Copyright version 0.1 .

SYNOPSIS
        my $c = Debian::Copyright->new();       # construct a new
        $c->read($file1);                       # parse debian copyright file
        $c->read($file2);                       # parse a second
        $c->write($ofile);                       # write to file

DESCRIPTION
    Debian::Copyright can be used for the representation, manipulation and
    merging of Debian copyright files in an object-oriented way. It provides
    easy reading and writing of the debian/copyright file found in Debian
    source packages.

FIELDS
  header
    An instance of Debian::Copyright::Stanza::Header class. Contains the the
    first stanza of the copyright file. If multiple files were parsed only
    the first will be retained.

  files
    A hash reference (actually Tie::IxHash instance) with keys being the
    values of the `Files' clause and values instances of
    Debian::Copyright::Stanza::Files class.

  licenses
    A hash reference (actually Tie::IxHash instance) with keys being the
    values of the `License' clause and values instances of
    Debian::Copyright::Stanza::License class.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
    Constructs a new Debian::Copyright instance.

    The `header' field is initialised with an empty string. The
    `files_block' and `license_block' fields are initialised with an empty
    instance of Tie::IxHash.

METHODS
  read *file*
    Parse debian and accessors.

    *file* can be either a file name, an opened file handle or a string
    scalar reference.

  write *file*
    Writes a debian/copyright-like file in *file* with the contents defined
    in the accessor fields.

    *file* can be either a file name, an opened file handle or a string
    scalar reference.

LIMITATIONS
    This module is written with one particular version of DEP-5 in mind.
    When required it should be easy to add support for extra versions, but
    at the moment the supported version is the one generally used in the
    Debian Perl Group.
    Test coverage is not yet complete.
